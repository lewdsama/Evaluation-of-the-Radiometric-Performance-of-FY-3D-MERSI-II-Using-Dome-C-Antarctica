1. The data preprocessing in this paper is mainly carried out by IDL and Arcmap, and the code is placed in the DataPreprocessing folder.

   The DataPreprocessing folder contains three files, FY-3D_MEISI-II_Geometric&Radiometric_Corrections.pro and SZA_B3B4_Extract.pro, and arcpy_clip_batch.txt.
         FY-3D_MEISI-II_Geometric&Radiometric_Corrections.pro： Contains code that extracts the band data from the FY-3D HDF file and performs the geometric and radiometric correction. This step                                                                      will generates the GLT file.
         SZA_B3B4_Extract.pro：
